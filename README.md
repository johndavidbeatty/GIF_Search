# GIF_Search
A page that will get GIF for different topics

The goal was:

-Responsive
-Local Storage
-Ability to add subjects
-Title without extra definitions (like "GIF" or "GIF by xxxx")
-Ability to add addition GIFs per subject
-Ability to remove subjects (even the base ones)

I think I hit all of these.
I didn't do favorite GIFs because by definition of having Add/Remove of subjects and local storage the user could have favorite tops.  I did think about doing a sidebar of favorite GIFs but just didn't have the time.
